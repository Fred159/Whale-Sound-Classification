# Whale-Sound-Classification
This is a HW of my college course. 
Code is downloaded from Urban-Sound-Classification coded by aqibsaeed/Urban-Sound-Classification, Urban sound classification using Deep Learning
I just used it and modified little errors because of Korean keyboard problem in glob part.
The original code is good enough to run ~~ ^^ ~~ .
